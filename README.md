# How to Arch

My **Arch Linux desktop installation** cheat sheet.

This tutorial is based on the official [Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide)
and [General recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations).

Follow the steps below to end up with a usable desktop edition of Arch Linux similar to the one I am running on my laptop.
Don't follow them blindly, though: this tutorial aggressively targets my personal preferences, which may not match yours
(such as having four different web browsers installed at the same time).

# How to Arch

My **Arch Linux desktop installation** cheat sheet.

This tutorial is based on the official [Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide)
and [General recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations).

Follow the steps below to end up with a usable desktop edition of Arch Linux similar to the one I am running on my laptop.
Don't follow them blindly, though: this tutorial aggressively targets my personal preferences, which may not match yours
(such as having four different web browsers installed at the same time).

## Make a liveUSB and boot it

Download an .iso file from https://archlinux.org/download/ and flush it to a flash drive in your favourite way, e.g.,
with `dd`:
```sh
sudo dd if=<path_to_image.iso> of=</dev/sdX_of_your_flash_drive> status=progress conv=notrunc,fsync bs=4M oflags=direct
```
(note the `/dev/sdX` rather than `/dev/sdXY`).

Next, boot the flash drive.

## Connect to wifi

```
$ iwctl
[iwd]# device lsit
< find your device here, e.g., "wlan0" >
[iwd]# station wlan0 scan
[iwd]# station wlan0 get-networks
< find your Wi-Fi network here >
[iwd]# station wlan0 connect <wifi_ssid>
< enter password here >
[iwd]# quit
$
```

## Partition the disk

### Create partitions with `parted`

First, run `parted` on your disk (e.g., `parted /dev/nvme0n1`), and
create the deisred partition layout.

Useful commands of `parted`:
-   `help` to see the list of commands
-   `help <command>` to see more information about a particular command
-   `unit s` to change the default unit to disk sectors, `unit GiB` for GiB, etc
-   `mkpart` to interactively create a partition

My layout during the last installation (in order):
-   EFI partition created by Windows 11
-   A few Windows partitions with C: of size 107GiB
-   An ext4 `/` partition of size 149GiB
-   An ext4 `/home` partition of size 220GiB

### Create filesystems

Next, create filesystems on the partitions you just created:
```sh
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p5
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p6
```
